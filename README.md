## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking and performance data to uncover key trends and insights. Using Python and data analysis libraries, the project explores patterns in room categories, city-wise performance, and other booking-related metrics, enabling data-driven recommendations for improving operational efficiency.  

## Key Features  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on hotel booking datasets.  
- Visualization of trends in bookings and performance.  
- Identification of city-wise performance and room category insights.  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for analysis.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Python**: Core programming language.  
- **Libraries**:  
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
  - **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For visualizing trends and insights.  

## Usage  
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Hotel_data_analysis.ipynb` in your preferred environment.  
2. Run the cells to view the data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.  

## Insights Gained  
- **City-wise Performance**: Identified cities with the highest revenue and booking rates.  
- **Room Preferences**: Analyzed customer preferences for different room types.  
- **Trends Over Time**: Observed patterns in bookings across seasons and months.
